Purpose of This Course:

This is a course in system software. This course is key to understanding the relationship between programs and how their execution is affected among various computer architectures. THIS IS A PROGRAMMING INTENSIVE COURSE. THE PROJECTS WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EFFORT ON YOUR PART. I WILL NOT EXTEND PROJECT DUE DATES! PLEASE PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

As a student, you will demonstrate your mastery of the course material not only via assigned projects but also via one take-home exam. To help you stay current, you will have weekly quizzes in canvas at the end of each week which will cover that week's course material.
