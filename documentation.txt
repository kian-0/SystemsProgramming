Started with creating a function to handled objectfile construction

Make a function to handle Record creation 
-> Created tRecord List: LinkedList for tRecords
-> Created mRecord List: LinkedList for mRecords
-> Created struct hRecord
-> Created struct eRecord

Created Pass2 taking in table from p2(Pass1)

Passes hRecord, rtable, mtable, and eRecord into GenerateObjectFile:
Only present in Pass2
Prints header 
Prints thru tRecord List
Prints thru mRecord List
Prints end

Created Instruction.c:
Handles opcode interpretation
Takes "string" opcode 
Returns hex representation

Moved Pass1 to a seperate file:
This was to make it easier for me to read 
as well as add the --pass1only option
