Copied all the code we did in class from rewatching recordings

I could not follow or understand 100% how the tokenizer workd
I found sscanf which can split the line into certain variables based on formatting
It has issues of its own as i discovered but tried mitigating
If i remember correctly that we discussed in class that isalpha might not be a great indicator 
I couldn't remember what the consensus was so i also imported <ctype.h> in headers.h
Added:
    char symbol[7];
    char opcode[32];
    char operand[32];
    int linepos = 0;
and
Replaced:
        while (token - strtok(line, " ")) {
            printf("\tToken: %s\n", token);
            token = strtok(NULL, " \t\n");
        }
with if isalpha block

Added:
    memset(symbol, '\0', sizeof(symbol));
    memset(opcode, '\0', sizeof(opcode));
    memset(operand, '\0', sizeof(operand));
Because noticed that lines dont have the pertaining info it would display the previous

In headers.h
Added: 
void IsInSymbolList(SymbolList table, char Test[7]);
void InsertSymbolList(SymbolList table, char Name[7], int Addr, int LineNum);
Just in case they were necessary like PrintSymbolTable
